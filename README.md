ðŸ“Œ Daily GitHub Push Script

Date: 15th September 2025

Today, I wrote a simple Bash script to automate daily pushes on GitHub. The script creates a file with the current date and timestamp, commits it with a meaningful message, and then pushes it to the repository. Iâ€™ve also scheduled it using cron, so it runs automatically every day. This helps in maintaining daily activity, practicing Git automation, and building a consistent GitHub contribution history.
